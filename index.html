          Japan is an island country located in East Asia. It is bordered by the
          Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east, and spans
          more than 3,000 kilometers along the coast of the continent from the
          Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Philippine Sea
          in the south. Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan encompasses a
          stratovolcanic archipelago of about 6,852 islands, with five main
          islands Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa Japan is
          officially divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally into eight
          regions. Approximately two-thirds of the country's terrain is
          mountainous and heavily forested, and less than one-eighth of land is
          suitable for agriculture. Consequently, Japan is among the most
          densely populated and urbanized countries in the world, with over 90%
          of its population living in urban areas. The largest of these is the
          metropolitan area centered on the capital city of Tokyo, which is the
          most populous in the world and home to more than 38 million people.
          Japan itself is the world's eleventh most populous country with a
          population of 126.2 million. The average winter temperature in Japan
          is 5.1 °C and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C .The highest
          temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C was recorded on July 23,
          2018.The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the
          rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July.
          In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June
          and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons
          often bring heavy rain.
